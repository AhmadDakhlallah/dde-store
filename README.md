# DDE Store

An app store for DDE built with DTK

## What is this?

This app store is designed for use with the Deepin Desktop Enviroments on other distributions. The official Deepin store is built around Debian and a web view with the Deepin repos on it, making it incompatible with other distros. This store is built with PackageKit and AppStream, so it should work perfect on [almost](#deepin-distro) any distro!

## Deepin Distro

This only applies to the official Deepin distro, not DDE in general. Deepin does not support AppStream, which provides this app with all the needed data. **This store is not supported on the Deepin distribution.** This was intended for other distros running DDE anyways, so I have no plans on ever supporting it. If Deepin starts using AppStream, I may consider it. If you're running Deepin and looking for an alternative app store, check out some other awesome projects like [Spark Store](https://www.spark-app.store) or [Deepines Store](https://deepines.com)!
